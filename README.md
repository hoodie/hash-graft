# HashTransformer

* might wanna find a catchier name
* or come up with some optimus prime jokes
* this think already works in [ascii-invoicer](https://github.com/ascii-dresden/ascii-invoicer), but there are not tests
* writing tests afterwards is dull, but I'm gonna have to do it
* cool examples will follow too
* might incorporated [Hashr](https://github.com/svenfuchs/hashr), cuz it look cool and usefull
